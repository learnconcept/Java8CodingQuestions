2. An ecommerce company deploys more than 20 services behind Amazon API Gateway.
The interaction between services is complex. Each service can potentially call several others,
making performance issues and errors difficult to identify. Some individual API calls have experienced slow response times.
The development team needs to quickly identify the underlying causes of the slowdowns.

   Which approach would MOST quickly identify the underlying cause of performance issues?

   Response: Correct. Unlike metrics or logs, X-Ray can help users quickly identify services by their relative response times.
   X-Ray can identify a poorly performing service from within a web of interacting services.
   Once identified, CloudWatch provides the context, including the logs and metrics necessary to study specific issues.
